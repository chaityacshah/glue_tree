The repo is a forked version of the original created by [@chaityacshah](https://github.com/chaityacshah).  It is intended for testing and developing.

## Progress
* Jul-31-2018: Preliminary codes for plotting the tree from 1D arrays generated from a Newick file.

## To-do/to-discuss
* Use `astrodendro` built-in plotter or generate similar 1D arrays from products?
